# Presentation of static data - Project 1

## Welcome to "Hotel Alexander" webpage.

### This project is about hotel "Alexander" webpage, designed to help people inquire about future bookings. The web page is divided into 4 pages: "Home", "Make inquiry", "Room Categories", and "About Us".

"Home" page shows the benefits of staying in our hotel and what are the features or any other specialities. On the right side of the background picture, there is a pop-up message where you can click on "BOOK NOW", and it will automatically lead you to the "Make inquiry" page.

"Make Inquiry" page is quite simple and basic, where user can input their details, like email, name, arrival & departure date, room category choice, and space for extra information if necessary. After that user needs to click on Submit, and the Hotel will respond to their email as soon as possible.

The "Room Categories" page is static with options for users to see different room categories when making a booking. The hotel is quite new, and the webpage is as well, so will take some time for the business to boost its performance, rate & reputation.

"About us" page is just a simple message regarding the hotel and their features.
