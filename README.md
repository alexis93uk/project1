"Make Inquiry" page is quite simple and basic, where user can input their details, like email, name, arrival & departure date, room category choice, and space for extra informationif necessary. After then user needs to click on Submit, and the Hotel will respond to their email as soon as possible.

"Room Categories" page is static with options for users to see different room categories when deciding to make a booking. Hotel is quite new, and webpage as well, so will take some time for the business to boost their performance, rate & reputation.
